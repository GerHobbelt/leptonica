# entries MAY contain wildcards.
#
# Note: any resulting duplicate file paths will be removed, so path specs MAY safely "overlap"
#       when you want to select multiple (overlapping) subsets of files.
#
#
# Extra: specify a set of paths to search; these MAY include wildcards as well!
#
# The FIRST path which delivers 1 or more matches for a line (a.k.a. 'spec') will be used for that line.
# Another spec line MAY use another path in the given search set, but every line will only use ONE path from the (wild-card-expanded) search set!
