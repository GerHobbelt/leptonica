/*
 * convertfilestopdf.c
 *
 *    Converts all image files in the given directory with matching substring
 *    to a pdf, with the specified scaling factor <= 1.0 applied to all
 *    images.
 *
 *    See below for syntax and usage.
 *
 *    The images are displayed at a resolution that depends on the
 *    input resolution (res) and the scaling factor (scalefact) that
 *    is applied to the images before conversion to pdf.  Internally
 *    we multiply these, so that the generated pdf will render at the
 *    same resolution as if it hadn't been scaled.  By downscaling, you
 *    reduce the size of the images.
 *
 *    For jpeg and jp2k, downscaling reduces pdf size by the square of
 *    the scale factor.
 *    * The jpeg quality can be specified from 1 (very poor) to 100
 *      (best available, but still lossy); use 0 for the default (75).
 *    * The jp2k quality can be specified from 27 (very poor) to 45 (nearly
 *      lossless; use 0 for the default (34).  You can use 100 to
 *      require lossless, but this is very expensive and not recommended.
